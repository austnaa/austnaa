# Heyo! 


<h3>I'm Austn Attaway, an aspiring software engineer. 
Since you are checking out my profile, here's a few of my 
favorite projects I have contributed to.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### TalkBox Android Chat App 

In the fall of 2021 my Mobile Application course tasked us with developing a full stack modern chat app for Android devices. 
The app included all the bells and whistles you would expect in a chat app and also included a dynamic weather page. We built the [front end](https://github.com/msanyok/Team-1-TCSS-450) in Android Studio using XML and Java, and the [back end](https://github.com/Skomegna/Team-1-TCSS-450-Server) was hosted on Heroku using Node.js and a PostgreSQL database. My team and I conducted daily stand ups, managed a storyboard of user stories, and conducted four 2 week sprints throughout the quarter. I made contributions in all aspects of the project, but especially focused on designing and implemeneting CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionalities for contacts, chat rooms, and messages. We created a short video to culminate our accomplishments that can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/N9kNeRD_wa4).

### Animal Assault
  
For many UW Tacoma computer science students the Computational World’s class is a must take course. This class allows us to create a JavaScript based game with few requirements and limitations. In the winter of 2022 my teammates and I went into the class with high expectations for ourselves and after 10 weeks of rigorous development, we felt like we reached them. We created Animal Assault, a top-down adventure game. It includes a “bullet hell” style of combat that takes place among multiple environments. I contributed heavily to the [repository](https://github.com/roseypark19/TCSS-491-Group-Project) including environment/level design and the town location, which required multiple clickable user interface components that had to be designed from scratch. I also implemented the local storage functionality that allows users to save their progress in their browser cache. You can play the game [here](https://roseypark19.github.io/TCSS-491-Group-Project/) and watch the gameplay trailer [here](https://youtu.be/_9G0nOoeQFo).

### Drawing Application

While not as flashy as some of my other projects, the Drawing Application project I completed in my first quarter at UW Tacoma was integral in my development as a software engineer. This project was a solo assignment that required me to follow a set of detailed instructions closely. I got practice building a project utilizing the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern and  heavily benefited from following the four principles of object oriented programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. I recall being proud about how clean and readable my code and documentation was on this project, and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/austnaa/DrawingApplication) if you would like.

### Trivia Maze


The Trivia Maze project is particularly special to me because it was the first group project I contributed to. Learning how to work in a team based environment took some getting used to and it wasn’t smooth sailing all the time. However, the project we created turned out to be worth being proud of and some of the lessons I learned in working as a unit have helped me greatly.
